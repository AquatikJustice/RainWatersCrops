# RainWatersCrops
Rain now has a chance to water seeded crops!

RainWatersCrops will give each seed you have planted a chance to be watered if it's raining in-game. You can configure that chance to be high, medium or low, or just set it to the value of your choosing. The default setting is medium (999,950).

Usage: 
rwcChance <high | medium | low> - sets it to those predefined values.
rwcChance custom <number> - sets it to the value of your choosing. Acceptable values are between 1 - 999,999.

This mod also saves your preference in a configuration file located in /mods/configs. This way you can keep the same values between gaming sessions w/o having to reset things every time.
